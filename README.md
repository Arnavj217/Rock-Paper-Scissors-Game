This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python. The game allows a user to play against the computer. 
The player inputs their choice (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer randomly selects its move. 
The program then compares both choices and determines the winner based on standard game rules. 
The game uses basic Python programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, and the random module. 
It can be played in the command-line interface and includes replay functionality for multiple rounds.
